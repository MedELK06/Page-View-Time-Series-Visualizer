# ðŸ“Š Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** curriculum.  
The goal is to analyze and visualize forum page view data from **2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03**.

We use **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to generate three different types of plots:
- A **line chart** (daily page views over time)
- A **bar chart** (monthly averages grouped by year)
- Two **box plots** (year-wise and month-wise distributions)
